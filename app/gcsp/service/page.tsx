          After attending a semester of EPICS in Spring 2024, a passionate spark for innovation lit in me as I 
          proposed my own stage 1 project in Fall 2024 for EPICS@ASU. Over 300 million dogs are abandoned to a 
          cruel "street-dog-life" in the world, without any human care, medical attention and population control.

          WoofCare is a mobile app designed to make a real difference in the lives of stray dogs in India. By 
          connecting everyday people with crowd-funded donation services, veterinary care, rescue shelters, and 
          potential adopters, we're striving to create a compassionate community that cares for our four-legged 
          friends.

              WoofCare embodies the "Joy of Living" theme by recognizing that quality of life extends beyond 
              humans to all living creatures who share our world. Stray dogs face daily suffering‚Äîhunger, disease, 
              injury, and neglect‚Äîand by creating a platform that connects compassionate people with resources to 
              help these animals, we're fostering a more empathetic and caring society. When people can easily 
              contribute to animal welfare, report dogs in need, and facilitate adoptions, it creates ripples of 
              joy: for the dogs who find care and homes, for the adopters who gain loyal companions, for the 
              communities that become safer and more humane, and for the volunteers and donors who experience the 
              fulfillment of making a difference. This project demonstrates that engineering solutions can address 
              not just human needs, but create a more compassionate world for all beings.

              Leading WoofCare from a Stage 1 concept to a Stage 3 project with 60+ NGO partnerships has been an 
              invaluable lesson in project management, team leadership, and stakeholder engagement. Presenting at 
              the EPICS Marketplace and recruiting 40+ interested students taught me how to articulate a vision and 
              inspire others to join a cause. Working with our Indian partners, including Mr. Malikaveetil and VOSD 
              Trust, has given me experience in cross-cultural collaboration, understanding different organizational 
              structures, and adapting solutions to local contexts. Technically, developing a production mobile app 
              with Flutter, Firebase, and integrating Google APIs has strengthened my full-stack development skills. 
              Managing a large team, coordinating with NGOs, and balancing technical development with community 
              outreach has prepared me for roles that require both technical expertise and people management‚Äîskills 
              essential for any engineering leader or social entrepreneur.

            <p className="text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
              This project has been deeply meaningful on a personal level. Growing up in India, I witnessed firsthand 
              the challenges faced by stray animals, and being able to create a solution that addresses this issue 
              connects my engineering education with my personal values of compassion and service. Seeing the project 
              grow from an idea to a Stage 3 initiative partnered with 60+ NGOs has been incredibly rewarding and has 
              reinforced my belief that one person's initiative can spark meaningful change. Working with Jesus Aguilar 
              and leading a diverse team has taught me the power of collaboration and how different perspectives 
              strengthen solutions. Most importantly, this experience has shown me that the most fulfilling engineering 
              work comes when technical skills are applied to problems that genuinely matter to me. It has given me 
              confidence that I can identify problems in my community and lead efforts to solve them, and it has 
              deepened my commitment to using my engineering career to create positive social impact.
