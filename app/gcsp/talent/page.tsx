          As part of FURI in Fall 2024, I started pursuing research under Dr. Paul Grogan on Reinforcement Learning 
          Techniques for autonomous satellite orientation in agile space missions for Earth Observation Systems. 
          Dynamic Targeting is an extensively researched concept used by satellites to point the instruments in 
          the optimal direction to get the maximum scientific yield.

        <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-3">The Challenge</h3>
        <p className="mb-4 text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
          Conventional methods use scheduling systems for determining points on the map that are worth observing. 
          Auto-scheduler systems are effective in selecting priority observations but these methods are not 
          real-time or fully accurate. Incorrect decisions by satellites lead to wastage of power and redundant 
          data. This research aims to enable satellites to autonomously determine valid observation locations in 
          real time during Earth Science Missions.

        <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-3">Research Approach</h3>
        <p className="mb-4 text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
          The project focuses on creating an RL environment that emulates the satellite's decisions to measure 
          over the priority observational points. This involves:

        <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-3">Current Results</h3>
        <p className="mb-4 text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
          Ongoing research has seen a policy-based DQN model and a Quantile-Regression DQN model perform with 
          79% recall. However, the results showed a low F1 score due to more false positive actions. The low 
          precision is potentially due to oversampling near the 0Â° latitude and the huge class imbalance in the 
          datasets derived from NASA GEOS-5.

        <p className="mb-4 text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
          The project focuses on preparing larger training datasets of 8-12 months with additional features like 
          cloud optical thickness and incoming shortwave flux. The project further aims to use Decision 
          Transformers or STTNs in ensemble with reinforcement learning to tackle the oversampling challenge.

        <p className="text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
          The research will be considered a success when the results correspond with the simulated data on 
          convective precipitation storms, proving a greater precision than predictive supervised learning models 
          like the random forest classifier.

          The ultimate goal of the research is to autonomously enable satellites in prioritizing areas with high

              This research directly contributes to the "Joy of Living" theme by improving the quality and 
              accuracy of Earth observation data. Better satellite targeting means more effective disaster 
              preparedness and response, saving lives during hurricanes, floods, and severe storms. Enhanced 
              meteorological predictions help farmers optimize crop yields, coastal communities prepare for 
              weather events, and cities better manage resources. By making satellite systems smarter and more 
              autonomous, we enable better decision-making that protects communities and improves daily life 
              for millions of people worldwide.
