          In Spring Break of 2025, I had the opportunity to participate in the EPICS in Action - Barcelona. 
          Those 8 days from March 8-16 have become lifelong memories now. The trip was intended to teach students 
          about human-centered design approach but it ended up teaching much more.

              The EPICS Barcelona experience exemplifies the "Joy of Living" theme by demonstrating how cultural 
              exchange and international collaboration enrich our lives and expand our perspectives. True joy comes 
              not just from material comfort, but from meaningful connections, new experiences, and understanding 
              different ways of life. By immersing ourselves in Spanish culture‚Äîfrom learning Flamenco to exploring 
              Gaud√≠'s architectural wonders to collaborating with local communities on the Beach Cleanup project‚Äîwe 
              gained appreciation for how different cultures approach problem-solving, celebrate life, and build 
              community. This experience showed that engineering solutions must be culturally sensitive and locally 
              adapted to truly improve quality of life. The friendships formed, perspectives gained, and memories 
              created during these eight days represent the type of enriching experiences that bring lasting joy 
              and fulfillment. By learning to appreciate and learn from different cultures, we become better 
              equipped to create solutions that enhance the "joy of living" for diverse communities worldwide.

            <p className="text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
              This international experience has been invaluable for my professional development as a global engineer. 
              Visiting the CDEI-UPC Center and learning about agricultural innovations in a Mediterranean context 
              taught me how engineering solutions must be adapted to local conditions, resources, and needs‚Äîa lesson 
              that's crucial for working on international projects. Collaborating with Spanish students and local 
              communities on the Beach Cleanup project developed my cross-cultural communication skills and showed me 
              how to navigate different working styles and expectations. Learning human-centered design in an 
              international context reinforced the importance of understanding cultural context when designing 
              solutions. These skills‚Äîcultural adaptability, international collaboration, and context-aware 
              design‚Äîare increasingly essential in today's globalized engineering workforce. Whether working for a 
              multinational company, collaborating on international projects, or developing products for global 
              markets, the ability to work effectively across cultures is critical. This experience has prepared me 
              to be a more effective engineer in international settings and has expanded my professional network to 
              include connections across borders.

            </h4>
            <p className="text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
              This trip was transformative on a personal level. Experiencing Barcelona's rich history and vibrant 
              culture‚Äîfrom the intricate details of Gaud√≠'s architecture to the passionate expression of Flamenco 
              dance‚Äîopened my eyes to different ways of seeing and experiencing the world. I learned that there are 
              multiple valid approaches to problems, different definitions of success, and varied ways of finding joy 
              and meaning in life. The friendships I formed with students from diverse backgrounds have become some of 
              my most valued connections, and they've given me a global network of friends who challenge my 
              assumptions and broaden my worldview. Perhaps most importantly, this experience made me more comfortable 
              with ambiguity and unfamiliarity. Navigating a new city, communicating across language barriers, and 
              adapting to different customs built my confidence and independence. These eight days taught me that 
              stepping outside my comfort zone leads to the most memorable experiences and significant personal growth. 
              I returned with not just technical knowledge, but with a deeper sense of global citizenship, greater 
              cultural empathy, and an appreciation for the diversity that makes our world so rich and interesting. 
              This experience has inspired me to continue seeking international opportunities and to approach life 
              with curiosity and openness to different perspectives.
