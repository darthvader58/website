          I took FSE 301 in Spring 2025 under Prof. Brent Sebold. As part of FSE 301, I learnt how to scale a 
          startup and create a value proposition of the product/service. The course teaches us about how to grow 
          startups and prepare pitches that convince users to pay for the product/service.

              Tansen directly embodies the "Joy of Living" theme by making musicâ€”one of humanity's most universal 
              sources of joyâ€”more accessible to everyone. Music has the power to bring people together, provide 
              emotional release, and offer a creative outlet that enriches daily life. However, learning an 
              instrument can be frustrating and expensive, often requiring private lessons and sheet music that 
              many people cannot afford. By using AI to instantly transcribe any song to any instrument and key, 
              Tansen democratizes music education, allowing anyone with a smartphone to learn their favorite songs 
              at their own pace. Whether someone wants to play guitar at campfires, piano for personal relaxation, 
              or any other instrument to express themselves creatively, Tansen removes barriers and makes the joy 
              of making music accessible to all. This aligns perfectly with creating opportunities for people to 
              pursue hobbies and passions that enhance their quality of life and bring daily happiness.

              Developing Tansen through FSE 301 has given me comprehensive experience in the startup journeyâ€”from 
              ideation to product development to business strategy. I learned to identify market opportunities, 
              define target customers, and create value propositions that resonate with users. Building the 
              technical product required integrating multiple AI models (Onsets & Frames, Demucs, Basic Pitch) and 
              creating a full-stack application with Flutter and FastAPI, which deepened my skills in audio 
              processing, deep learning, and mobile development. Perhaps most importantly, I learned how to pitch 
              a technical product to both technical and non-technical audiences, translating complex AI capabilities 
              into clear user benefits. The course taught me about unit economics, customer acquisition strategies, 
              and scaling challengesâ€”knowledge that's invaluable whether I pursue entrepreneurship or work at a 
              tech company. This experience has prepared me to launch products, understand business models, and 
              think about technology through the lens of real user needs and market viability.

              As someone passionate about both music and technology, creating Tansen has been uniquely fulfillingâ€”it 
              combines my technical skills with my love for music in a way that could genuinely help people. Working 
              on this project has taught me that the most meaningful innovations often come from addressing problems 
              you personally understand. I've experienced the frustration of wanting to learn songs but finding 
              transcriptions unavailable or inaccurate, and building a solution to this problem has been deeply 
              satisfying. The entrepreneurship process has also taught me resilience and adaptabilityâ€”from dealing 
              with model performance issues to refining the business model based on feedback. Most importantly, this 
              experience has shown me that I can take an idea from concept to working prototype to viable business 
              plan. It has given me the confidence to pursue my own ventures and the understanding that entrepreneurship 
              isn't just about having ideas, but about execution, persistence, and genuinely understanding your users' 
              needs. This project has reinforced that I want to build products that enhance people's lives and bring 
              them joy, whether through my own startups or innovative work within established companies.
