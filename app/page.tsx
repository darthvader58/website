        Hello There! I'm Shashwat Raj.
      </h1>
      <p className="mb-4">
        I am a sophomore at <span className="font-medium">Arizona State University</span>, pursuing a dual major in <span className="font-medium">Computer Systems Engineering</span> and <span className="font-medium">Mathematics</span> with a GPA of 3.78/4.0.

      <p className="mb-4">
        I'm passionate about robotics, machine learning, and software development. Currently, I'm working as a Machine Learning Developer and Researcher at the Collective Design (CoDe) lab at ASU, where I'm developing Reinforcement Learning techniques to optimize Earth science missions for autonomous priority observations in space.

        I'm also the Founder & CEO of <span className="font-medium">WoofCare Solutions</span>, a mobile app connecting dog lovers and care services to improve the lives of stray dogs in India. This project is funded by EPICS (Engineering Projects In Community Service) at ASU and partners with over 60+ NGOs.

        When I'm not coding or researching, you can find me playing the flute, working on Battlebots, boxing, creating digital art, or hosting my podcast <span className="font-medium">"Write It Out"</span>.
